The path that we have chosen to take begins with an \textit{abstract} problem into which the
\textit{concrete} continuous problems (equations), for which we shall design preconditioners later, 
can be recast. To present the problem, let us first fix the notation.

\subsection{Notation and preliminaries}
Let $V$ be a Hilbert space over some bounded domain $\Omega$. The space of bounded
linear functionals over $V$\footnote{Functional over $V$ is a mapping taking functions 
from $V$ and returning numbers, e.g. $v \mapsto \int_{\Omega} v(x)\,\mathrm{d}x$} 
shall be denoted $\dual{V}$. For $f\in\dual{V}$ the value of the functional in function 
$v\in V$ is $\brack{f, v}_{\dual{V}, V}$. We denote by $(\cdot, \cdot)_V$
the inner product of $V$ and $\norm{\cdot}_V$ shall be the corresponding norm,
i.e. $\norm{u}_V=\sqrt{(u, u)_V}$ for all $u\in V$. The norm of $\dual{V}$ is then 
$\norm{f}_{\dual{V}}=\sup_{v\in V}\tfrac{\semi{\brack{f, v}_{\dual{V},
V}}}{\norm{v}_V}$. Finally, we will use a shorthad notations for the norms and
inner products of $L^2(\Omega)$ and $H^1(\Omega)$ spaces
%
\[
  (u, v) = \int_{\Omega} u(x) v(x)\,\mathrm{d}x,
  \quad
  \norm{u} = \sqrt{(u, u)}
  \quad
  \mbox{ and }
  \quad
  \norm{u}_1 = \sqrt{\norm{u}^2 + \norm{\nabla{u}}^2}.
\]
%

Given $V$ with inner product $(\cdot, \cdot)_V$ suppose that $u\in V$ is fixed and
consider a mapping $f_u: v\rightarrow (u, v)_V$. Using Cauchy-Schwarz theorem\footnote{
  Recall that the angle $\theta$ of two vectors $\la{u}, \la{v} \in \reals^n$ is 
  defined as $\cos{\theta}=\frac{
    \semi{\la{u}\cdot {v}}
  }
  {
    \semi{\la{u}\cdot\la{u}}\semi{\la{v}\cdot\la{v}}
  }$. But then clearly
\[
  \semi{\la{u}\cdot\la{v}} 
  \leq \norm{\la{u}}\norm{\la{v}}
  \quad\quad
  \norm{\la{u}}=\sqrt{\la{u}\cdot\la{u}}
\]
holds for all vectors in $\reals^n$. Cauchy-Schwarz inequality is a generalization
of the statement above.}
%
see e.g. \site{brenner}, we have $\semi{(u, v)_V}\leq\norm{u}_V\norm{v}_V$ and so
$f_u\in \dual{V}$. Looking at $f_u$ we see that (some) elements of $\dual{V}$ can 
be manufactured via inner products. The \textit{Riesz map} theorem states that
\textit{all} the elements can be manufactured this way.

\begin{theorem}[Riesz]\label{thm:riesz}
  Given Hilbert space $V$ with an inner product $(\cdot, \cdot)_V$ there exists
  for every $f\in \dual{V}$ a unique function $\tau f\in V$ such that $\brack{f,
  v}_{\dual{V}, V}=(\tau f, v)_V$ for all $v\in V$. 
  Moreover, $\norm{f}_{dual{V}}=\norm{\tau f}_V$ (the Riesz map $\tau$ is an
  isometry).
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
See ?
\end{proof}

Note that in Theorem \ref{thm:riesz} we can consider the space $V$ with a different 
inner product and the choice will give rise to a different Riesz map. This is
illustrated in the next example, which is taken from \site{malek}. 

\begin{example}[Riesz maps for $H^1$]\label{ex:riesz}
  The space $V=H^1_0(\Omega)\subset H^1(\Omega)$ of $H^1$ functions taking zero values 
  on the boundary $\Omega$ is first considered with the inner product inducing the
  $\norm{\cdot}_1$ norm. For $f\in \dual{V}$ given, the definition of
  the Riesz map $\tau$ and the inner product then yields
  % 
  \[
    \brack{f, v}_{\dual{V}, V} = (\tau f, v)_V = (u, v) + (\nabla u, \nabla v)
    \quad \forall v\in V.
  \]
  %
  That is, the Riesz map with respect to this inner product produces $u=\tau f$
  where $u$ is the weak solution of the Helmholtz problem
  \[
    \begin{aligned}
      -\Delta u + u &= f\quad\mbox{ in }\Omega,\\
                  u &= 0\quad\mbox{ on }\partial\Omega.\\
    \end{aligned}
  \]

  We recall now that Poincar{\'e} inequality holds on $V$, i.e. there exists
  constant $C>0$ such that $\norm{u} \leq C \norm{\nabla u}$ for all $u\in V$. In
  turn $\norm{u}^2_1\leq(C^2+1)\norm{\nabla u}^2$ so that
  %
  \[
    (C^2+1)^{-1}\norm{\nabla}^2_1 \leq \norm{\nabla u}^2 \leq
    \norm{u}^2_1\quad\forall u \in V
  \]
  %
  and $u\mapsto \norm{\nabla u}$ thus defines a equivalent norm on $V$. If we next
  define a Riesz map with respect to the inner product inducing the new norm we
  obtain
  %
  \[
    \brack{f, v}_{\dual{V}, V} = (\nabla \tau f, \nabla v) \quad\forall v\in V.
  \]
  %
  The Riesz representation $u=\tau f$of $f$ is therefore a solution of the Poisson 
  problem
  \[
    \begin{aligned}
      -\Delta u &= f\quad\mbox{ in }\Omega,\\
                  u &= 0\quad\mbox{ on }\partial\Omega.\\
    \end{aligned}
  \]
\end{example}
  At this point we are ready to define an abstract problem and discuss its
  well-posedness.

%

\subsection{Existence}
  The abstract continuous problem shall be defined in terms of the bilinear form
  $a:V\times V\rightarrow \reals$ which is assumed to satisfy the following
  assumptions
  %
  \begin{subequations}\label{eq:lm_assume}
  \begin{align}
    \label{eq:contin}
    \mbox{There exists } C > 0 \mbox{ such that } \semi{a(u, v)\leq &C\norm{u}_V\norm{v}_V}
    \quad\forall u, v\in V, \\
    %%%%%
    \label{eq:coerc}
    \mbox{There exists }\alpha > 0 \mbox{ such that } \semi{a(u, u)\geq &\alpha\norm{u}^2_V}
    \quad\forall u\in V.
  \end{align}
  \end{subequations}
  %
  If \eqref{eq:lm_assume} hold we say that the bilinear form is continous and
  $V$-elliptic.

  Let now $u\in V$ be fixed and define $Au$ by $\brack{Au, v}_{\dual{V}, V}=a(u, v)$. 
  From the continuity condition \eqref{eq:contin} it follows that
  $Au\in\dual{V}$. However, we are interested in a more intriguing problem: given
  $b\in V$ we want to find $u\in V$ such that
  %
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:abstract}
    Au = b\quad\mbox{ in }\dual{V}
    \mbox{ or equivalently}
    \brack{Au, v}_{\dual{V}, V} = \brack{b, v}_{\dual{V}, V}\quad\forall v\in V.
  \end{equation}
  %
  Existence of solution of \eqref{eq:abstract} is the subject of Lax-Milgram
  theorem.
